node_setup
============
Cloned from http://github.com/startup-class/setup to install prerequisite
programs and configure 'bash' and 'emacs' dev environments on new EC2 instance
running Ubuntu 12.04.02 LTS. 
If all goes well, in addition to a more useful prompt, now you can
do `emacs -nw hello.js` and hitting `C-c!` to launch an interactive SSJS
REPL, among many other features. See the
[Startup Engineering Video Lectures 4a/4b](https://class.coursera.org/startup-001/lecture/index)
for more details. Now with friendlier colors against black backgrounds.
